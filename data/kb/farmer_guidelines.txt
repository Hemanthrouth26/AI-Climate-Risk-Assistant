Farmer Guidelines for Climate Risks:

Heatwave Protection Techniques for Crops and Farmers:
- Mulch soil around plants to retain moisture and reduce evaporation.
- Water crops during early morning or late evening to minimize water loss.
- Use shade cloth or row covers for heat-sensitive crops.
- Farmers should wear wide-brimmed hats, long sleeves, and take frequent breaks in shade.
- Monitor soil moisture levels regularly and adjust irrigation accordingly.
- Plant heat-tolerant crop varieties when possible.
- Implement crop rotation to maintain soil health under stress.

Flood Protection Measures for Crops and Agricultural Land:
- Build raised beds or use elevated planting areas for crops.
- Install drainage systems to divert excess water away from fields.
- Use flood-resistant crop varieties and avoid planting in low-lying areas.
- Store equipment and supplies in elevated, waterproof storage.
- Have contingency plans for relocating livestock to higher ground.
- Use sandbags or temporary barriers to protect vulnerable areas.
- Monitor weather forecasts and prepare for quick harvesting if needed.

Air Pollution Impact on Crops and Farmer Health Safety:
- Plant windbreaks or buffer zones with trees to reduce airborne pollutants.
- Use protective masks and clothing when working in polluted areas.
- Monitor crop health for signs of pollution damage like leaf discoloration.
- Wash produce thoroughly before consumption.
- Farmers should avoid smoking and limit exposure to diesel exhaust.
- Support sustainable farming practices to reduce pollution sources.
- Educate about symptoms of pollution-related health issues.
